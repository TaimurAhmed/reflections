Me:
	Creating a symbolic link is basically just a flag and directory path

Q.	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
	a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A.	IDE, industry standard, a lot less tedious when writing a report.

Q.	What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
	create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
	saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros: Made for programming
	Con: Easy to forget and bad practice

Q.	Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
	multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
	each file separately??

	So that you can track connected files together e.g. html+css+js
	also not git log stats
	and git log diff by comparing their ids

Q.	How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
	of files?

	git log: can be used to see LIFO version of history
	git diff: Compare new to old (FOFI)

Q. 	How might using version control make you more confident to make changes
	 that could break something?
	 You can aways go back 

Q.	 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
