-
git add git commit
git branch master
git log
git diff
git diff xx xx
git diff --staged

-
git branch
git branch easy-mode
git checkout easy-mode
git branch //to see status
git diff
git add
git diff
git diff --staged
git commit
git status
git log
git diff --staged

git reset —hard (use carefully and google, basically SHOULD remove everything that has not been committed and CANNOT be undone)

—-
git checkout … can causes detached head state
git checkout -b newbranchname will cause a new branch at checkout point
